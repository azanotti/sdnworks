However, the upgrade workflow within SDDC Manager wouldn’t proceed due to this incompatibility check.\nTo resolve this issue the following steps were performed:\nAccess SDDC Manager\u0026rsquo;s development center Select API category Domains Run the GET /v1/domains API and note down the affected domain ID Move to API category TargetUpgradeVersion Run the PATCH /v1/releases/domains/{domainId} API using the domain ID obtained in step 3 Retry the upgrade by selecting 5.1 as target version ","date":"14 September 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/posts/vcf/resetupgradetarget/","section":"Ens","summary":"","title":"Reset VCF domain upgrade target version","type":"en"},{"content":"","date":"14 September 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/sddc-manager/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"SDDC Manager","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"14 September 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/upgrade/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Upgrade","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"14 September 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/vcf/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"VCF","type":"categories"},{"content":"","date":"14 September 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/privacy/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Privacy","type":"categories"},{"content":" Privacy Policy of sdnworks.com # Alessandro Zanotti operates the sdnworks.com website, which provides the SERVICE.\nThis page is used to inform website visitors regarding our policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use our Service, the sdnworks.com website.\nIf you choose to use our Service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation with this policy.
